EPURWP is a tool which allows updates and modifications of the <A HREF="docwp.html#DataDesc"></A>
<A HREF="docwp.html#DataDesc">white pages database</A>.

Two optional parameters may follow.  

The first will specify how many days will go by before a data is valid. 
If the temporary part of the record has not changed during this time, 
it will be considered as stable and transferred to the primary (used) part.

The second parametre states how many days will go by before the record is
deleted from the database.  This is how many days go by with no updates
or refreshes of this user's data.
